# Kali-Randomize-MACs
Simple script to randomize your MAC addresses on all interfaces and reinitialize your network-manager. 

Matches interfaces, ignores loopback and attempts to randomize the MAC addresses. Future versions will include a prompt to specify what kind of MAC Adress you would like (fully random, same vendor, different vendor random).
